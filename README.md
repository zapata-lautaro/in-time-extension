The other day I was watching the "In-time" movie starring Justin Timberlake where the people have to pay for things with time instead of money. I thought It would be a good idea to have a Chrome extension that transforms the prices of products in pages like Mercado Libre, Fravega, etc, to time according to the salary you have. As a first version, I'll develop this extension mainly focused on Argentinian pages and currencies, but the idea could be extended to other countries and currencies in the future.

The main features of this extension will be:

- Allow the user to set their monthly salary in Argentinian pesos (ARS) or US Dollars (USD)
- Convert the prices in the supported pages to time with format yyyy MM dd hh mm (rounding to a minute as the minimum value) based on the user salary
- Allow the user to switch the price conversion to time at any time
- Provide a simple calculator where the user can input a price and convert it to time

This extension has 2 proposes, first: It gave me the chance to learn about chrome extension development, and second I think It would be a useful tool for people to start associating the prices of products with the time it costs them to earn that money, and luckily make them think twice before do an impulsive purchase.
